# AutoEncoder

This repository provides implementations of AutoEncoders and their variants, with a focus on Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) using PyTorch. AutoEncoders are neural networks used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings and generative modeling. The repo is intended for anyone interested in understanding, experimenting with, or extending autoencoder architectures, especially for image data.

## Contents

- `VariationalAutoEncoder.ipynb`: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook detailing the implementation, training, and visualization of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) on the MNIST dataset. The notebook includes:
  - Explanation of VAE concepts
  - PyTorch-based model definition
  - Training process and loss function (reconstruction + KL divergence)
  - Visualization of original, latent, and reconstructed images
  - Insights and possible next steps for experimentation

## Key Features

- **VAE Implementation**: Learn how to construct and train a VAE for generative modeling tasks.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Markdown cells provide conceptual background, loss derivation, and the reparameterization trick.
- **Visualization**: Includes code to visualize original, latent, and reconstructed data, helping you understand the workings of the model.
- **Extendable**: Easily modify the code for other datasets or network architectures.

## What is a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)?

A Variational AutoEncoder is a type of generative model that learns a probability distribution over a latent space, enabling the generation of new data samples. It is built on top of the standard AutoEncoder architecture, with key differences:
- The encoder outputs mean and log-variance vectors instead of a single latent vector.
- Uses the reparameterization trick to enable backpropagation through the stochastic sampling process.
- The loss function combines reconstruction loss and KL-divergence regularization.

For more conceptual details, see the explanations in the notebook.
